<heading><b>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</b></heading> <p> To me, accessibility means to make something easy or more navigable to use. 
  It's important to build more accessible websites because it allows for everyone to use it and may get you a larger audience.   </p>

<heading><b>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</b></heading> <p> Progressive enhancment mainly focuses on the content. To get in that mindset we have to think about the content first and then base all other aspects on the content we chose. It's important in momdern web development because it ensures that your website is usable by people with older browsers, slower internet connections, or disabilities. It also helps your site perform well on all devices by loading only the necessary resources and etc. <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=8f5f1a072f0127ae1cafe2a0697a5e722b185a7fd28e9905fffe8bb4b36f7391JmltdHM9MTczMjE0NzIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=13e6bfd1-8c1c-63b8-20bc-abab8d1462c9&psq=why+is+progressive+enhancement+important+in+modern+web+development&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9kZXYudG8vdGVjbGVhcm4vd2ViLXRoZW9yeS1wYXJ0LTctcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUtZW5oYW5jZW1lbnQtYS1kZXNpZ24tcGhpbG9zb3BoeS10by1idWlsZC15b3VyLXdlYnNpdGUtZm9yLWV2ZXJ5b25lLTQ1YiM6fjp0ZXh0PVdoeSUyMFVzZSUyMFByb2dyZXNzaXZlJTIwRW5oYW5jZW1lbnQlM0YlMjAxJTIwQWNjZXNzaWJpbGl0eSUzQSUyMEVuc3VyZXMlMjB0aGF0LGFuZCUyMG1haW50YWluJTIweW91ciUyMHNpdGUlMjBhcyUyMG5ldyUyMHRlY2hub2xvZ2llcyUyMGVtZXJnZS4&ntb=1" target="_blank">Progressive Enhancment</a>

<heading><b>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</b></heading> <p>I asked a few people what they thought about my website and the answers were the same. They thought it looked really good and the colors I chose matched the space theme. One thing my cousin suggested was that I should add more pictures. I agree with this suggestion because I only have one picture and pictures usually make websites look better in my opinion.

  I personally feel overall I did a pretty good job with this website. I've never imagiend myself making an actual website and designing it but I learned a lot form this course. Doing css is my favorite part because it really gets into the visuals of the website and I like playing around with the different code attributes to create things. I tried taking everything I learned all school year and putting it into this website. In the beginning of starting this project, I was kind of worried that I wouldn't know what to do but as I got started the ideas kept flowing in. 
I also started getting out of my shell and asking for help because I'm usually someone who just figure's stuff out on my own without asking for help.
